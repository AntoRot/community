## v1.0.2

**Status:** merged into master

**Release date:** 07/03/2019

### Modifications in ETS and ATS for the issue #117
Some modifications are needed in the ETS code. The validations have been divided in two main blocks of code. In a first step the ETS validates that exists at least one url that is a valid service (WFS, WMS, WCS, SOS or Atom). In a second step, if one or more URL exists and is valid, there will be no 'TR.unknownXMLResource' errors. If there is not any available URL, some warning(s) will be shown.

### Modifications in ETS and ATS for the issue #130 
Some improvements in the code: 
This test case only applies to records with a hierarchyLevel value 'dataset' or 'series'. 
For every DQ_ConformanceResult element, check if there is at least one specification. In case there is none, the test fails.
The DQ_ConformanceResult has an element gmd:pass that must contain a value of type gco:Boolean.
